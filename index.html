i like to dive into the ocean, hit the random button, read the words of other fish, and feel their presence all around.

a grim storm is raging outside. the sky lies dim and blurred behind a curtain of thick rain. the heavy air clings to everything, dampened by rain. the world drowns in the relentless voice of rain. 
from the balcony, the streets look deserted, emptied of all life. the muddy river has risen high, spilling onto the wooden boardwalks in a threatening surge. gusts of wind batter the frail trees along the banks. and the yard is strewn with fallen branches and yellowing leaves. 
in the bleak, shadowed room, only the kitchen light and the gently bubbling curry pot bring a hint of warmth.

after a few bouts of rain, the grass was alive with tiny grasshoppers and tiny snails. while walking my dog, i found snails inching across the path where people usually pass. worried they might be stepped on, i gathered them up and set them down by the riverbank where rotting wood and mushrooms thrive. autumn was already here. the orchid trees shed their golden leaves, gazing at their reflection in the languid current. near the water, the sleepy grass spread its graceful blossoms of tender violet. my dog wriggled about, bounding from bush to bush, sending its leaves folding closed in a hurry. in the cycle of the 24 solar terms, today marks 處暑, the 'end of heat'. with the air cooler, i could stroll a bit longer than on the sweltering summer days. yet, a storm was drawing near. the sun seemed eager to set, so we made our way home before the wild winds began to rise. as the rain tapped on the window, we sat down to steamed rice, veggie patties on lemongrass stalks, boiled pumpkin shoots, pickled figs and spring rolls.

when was the last time the numbers on social media — likes, comments, followers — felt more human in scale? the sky was dull all day, a muted steel-blue. i thought it would rain. it never did. still, i stayed inside. with the past few lively days behind me, i was slowly coming back to myself by cooking alone and getting lost in 'rocannon’s world'. my meal was steamed rice with chestnuts, sweet leaf soup with egg, braised tofu with mushrooms and daikon. at noon i lay down among my sleeping cats. the hour's stillness wrapped around us like a blanket. a weighty one.

woke up with one cheek bathed in warmth; apparently the sunlight had managed to steal into the room through the window.

.what are the words i do not have yet?
.how will i go about finding that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to me?

.rest is rebellion against a society that neglects the body's needs.
.you do not have to be good / you do not have to walk on your knees / for a hundred miles through the desert repenting / you only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves ~ mary oliver, wild geese 

.do the work and trust the process. those useless days of waiting, wandering, and wondering will add up to your becoming.
.getting good at anything is mostly about doing the work - figuring out how to start and then surrendering yourself to the hours.
